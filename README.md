# Accapto
Accessible App Tool (Work In Progress)

Accapto is a command line tool that creates a basic app structure from an xml input file. 

## Why as command line tool? 
A command line tool can be called from a GUI or a server, and therefore Accapto can be included in further projects. 

## Doku
For further information (e.g. how to get the project into Eclipse or write an input file) have a look at the Documentation-PDF file called 'AccaptoDocumentation-PA2_Bergmann_Kirchmaier'. 


## Further plans
As the name of the project suggests, the plan is to include an accessibility library to make it easy for app developers to create accessible apps.
